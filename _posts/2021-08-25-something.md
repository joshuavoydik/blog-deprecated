It's a new day and i've thought so much about NFTs. I am doing this deep dive, going down the rabbit hole. the implications are kind of insane. having been in crypto since 2014-2015 (yes i sold and should have held and followed my own advice but i didn't and that's my fault) but it seems like NFTs are an unlock because they're helping bolster new economies. sure we can talk about the creator economy but NFTs are interesting because they might be able to be used as keys or doorways into communities, entrances into certain experiences. theres also the verification bit that might help verify identities, etc....

It's becoming obvious that crypto is the future as the entire financial stack is being rewritten but this is a long process and we are in early days though i do think that when people look at the momentum up close, like really take a look, it will already be here.
