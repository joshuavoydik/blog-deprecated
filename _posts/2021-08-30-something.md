I've been thinking a lot about communication in our startup because it's been difficult to get alignment as we grow. Perhaps this is part structure and part being remote. It's really tough because someone will say something and it will be interpreted by someone else in a different way than intended. Things are getting lost in translation. So people and communication management and alignment that are mission critical. I'm realizing that in order to build a successful company especially a remote one, scaling effective communication is key.

Some ideas on how to improve
- Be professional
- Over communicate mission, values, goals
- Start with why
- Be transparent
- We need better documentation
- Be more collaborative
